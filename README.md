# popout-feedback

This is quick little snippet of a pop-out feedback form that I threw together.

It can be integrated into pretty much any website as a quick and convenient way of allowing users to provide feeback.

## Usage

This is just plain vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. So it can be pretty much dropped into most web projects.
